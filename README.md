- **Save and Share Coordinates:** Quickly save your current location along with a custom description and icon.
- **Real-time HUD Updates:** View your current coordinates as well as nearby players' positions directly on your screen.

## Development Background

I created this mod to make playing Minecraft with my son even more fun!

In Survival Mode, a bunch of different monsters can appear, which can be scary for a kid. But with this mod, my son can instantly see where I am, and if anything happens, I can rush right over to help him.

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).
2. Place the mod JAR file into your Minecraft mods folder.
3. Launch Minecraft using the Fabric profile.

## Usage

- Press **G** to save your current position.
- Press **B** to open the coordinates list screen.
- Change settings via the mod's settings screen.
- The HUD will display real-time coordinate data and notifications as you play.
